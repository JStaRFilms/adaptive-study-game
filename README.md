## üîß Getting Started

This application is designed to run in a web-based development environment that can serve static files and provide environment variables.

### Prerequisites

- A modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).
- A Google Gemini API Key.

### Configuration

The application requires a Google Gemini API key to function. This key must be available as an environment variable named `API_KEY`.

The application's code (`services/geminiService.ts`) expects to access the key via `process.env.API_KEY`. Please ensure this environment variable is correctly configured in your deployment or development environment.

**Note**: The API key is not to be hard-coded into the application. The app is built with the assumption that the execution environment securely provides this key.

### Running the Application

1. Ensure the `API_KEY` environment variable is set.
2. Serve the `index.html` file from the root of the project directory.
3. Open the served URL in your web browser. The application will initialize and be ready to use.
