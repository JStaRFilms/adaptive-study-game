## ‚ú® Key Features

- **AI-Powered Quiz Generation**: Automatically creates high-quality quizzes from your study materials.
- **Multimodal Input**: Generate quizzes from a mix of sources:
  - Pasted text notes
  - Documents (`.txt`, `.pdf`, `.docx`, `.md`)
  - Spreadsheets (`.xlsx`, `.csv`)
  - Images (`.png`, `.jpg`, `.webp`)
  - Audio Files (`.mp3`, `.m4a`, `.wav`, etc.) - The AI transcribes the content for you.
- **Flexible Knowledge Sources**: Choose how the AI generates questions:
  - **Notes Only**: Strictly uses the materials you provide.
  - **Notes + AI Knowledge**: Supplements your notes with the AI's vast general knowledge.
  - **Notes + Web Search**: Uses Google Search to find the latest information on your topic.
- **Multiple Question & Study Modes**:
  - **Practice Mode**: Timed multiple choice, true/false, and fill-in-the-blank questions.
  - **Review Mode**: Untimed, self-paced version of Practice Mode.
  - **Exam Mode**: A simulated exam with open-ended questions requiring long-form answers.
- **AI-Powered Exam Grading**: In Exam Mode, submit typed answers and **upload images of handwritten work**. The AI grades your responses against a rubric, providing a score and detailed feedback for each question.
- **AI Exam Prediction**: A powerful "detective mode" where the AI acts as your teacher to predict likely exam questions. Prime the AI with your teacher's persona, past exams, and other materials for a highly tailored study guide.
- **Gamified Learning**: Earn points, build streaks, and get speed bonuses in Practice Mode.
- **Persistent Study Sets**: Create, edit, and save study sets. Your notes and associated files are saved in your browser's local storage.
- **Quiz History & Progress Tracking**: Every quiz session is automatically saved. Review past attempts to track your scores, accuracy, and improvement over time.
- **Detailed Feedback & Review**: After each quiz, access a comprehensive review screen showing each question, your answer, the correct answer, and a clear explanation or AI-generated feedback.
- **Responsive Design**: A clean, modern, and fully responsive UI built with Tailwind CSS.


## üöÄ Project Philosophy
> This project is built on a few core principles:
> 1.  **AI-First Experience**: Leveraging the powerful, multimodal `gemini-2.5-flash` model to provide intelligent features that feel like magic.
> 2.  **Frictionless Development**: By using browser-native ES Modules and a CDN (`esm.sh`), the project avoids complex build steps. There's no `npm install`, no bundler configuration‚Äîjust modern web technologies.
> 3.  **User-Centric Design**: The entire experience, from the landing page to the quiz review screen, is designed to be intuitive, engaging, and effective for learning. Data is stored locally in the user's browser, ensuring privacy and persistence without a backend.


## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

1.  **Create a Study Set**: Add your notes by pasting text or uploading files (`.pdf`, `.docx`, images, audio, etc.). Your sets are saved for later.
2.  **Choose Your Path**:
    - **Study**: The app analyzes your notes, identifies key topics, and lets you configure a quiz (Practice, Review, or Exam Mode).
    - **Predict**: Enter the Exam Prediction mode. Provide details about your teacher's style, upload past exams or quizzes, and let the AI generate a list of probable exam questions to guide your studying.
3.  **Take the Quiz**: Play through the generated quiz, score points, and actively learn the material. For exams, type your answers or upload photos of your work.
4.  **Get AI-Graded Results**: After an exam, the AI evaluates your answers, providing scores and constructive feedback. For practice quizzes, see a summary of your score and accuracy.
5.  **Review and Reinforce**: Dive into a detailed review of your answers. From here, you can retake the same quiz or start a new one.


## üíª Tech Stack
This app is built with a modern, build-free stack, focusing on performance and developer experience.

-   **Core Framework**: [React](https://react.dev/) (with Hooks) & [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for a robust and type-safe UI.
-   **AI Engine**: [Google Gemini API](https://ai.google.dev/) (`gemini-2.5-flash`) for all intelligent features, including quiz generation, exam grading, and prediction.
-   **Styling**: [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for a utility-first, responsive design system.
-   **Module System**: Browser-native ES Modules loaded directly from the [esm.sh](https://esm.sh/) CDN. This eliminates the need for local `node_modules` or a bundling step.
-   **Client-Side File Processing**:
    -   [PDF.js](https://mozilla.github.io/pdf.js/) for parsing `.pdf` files.
    -   [Mammoth.js](https://github.com/mwilliamson/mammoth.js) for extracting text from `.docx` files.
    -   [SheetJS](https://sheetjs.com/) for handling `.xlsx` and `.csv` spreadsheets.


## üîß Getting Started

This application is designed to run in a web-based development environment that can serve static files and provide environment variables.

### Prerequisites

- A modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).
- A Google Gemini API Key.

### Configuration

The application requires a Google Gemini API key to function. This key must be available as an environment variable named `API_KEY`.

The application's code (`services/geminiService.ts`) expects to access the key via `process.env.API_KEY`. Please ensure this environment variable is correctly configured in your deployment or development environment.

**Note**: The API key is not to be hard-coded into the application. The app is built with the assumption that the execution environment securely provides this key.

### Running the Application

1. Ensure the `API_KEY` environment variable is set.
2. Serve the `index.html` file from the root of the project directory.
3. Open the served URL in your web browser. The application will initialize and be ready to use.


## üó∫Ô∏è Roadmap

- [ ] **Enhanced Gamification**: Leaderboards, achievements, and shareable results.
- [ ] **Deeper Analysis**: Provide users with insights into their weak spots and suggest topics to focus on.
- [ ] **More Question Types**: Introduce diagram labeling, matching, and sequencing questions.
- [ ] **Collaborative Study Sets**: Allow users to share their study sets with others.
- [ ] **Localization**: Translate the UI into multiple languages.
