## üöÄ Project Philosophy
> This project is built on a few core principles:
> 1.  **AI-First Experience**: Leveraging the powerful Gemini family of models, using `gemini-2.5-flash` for fast, real-time interactions and `gemini-2.5-pro` for high-quality analysis and generation tasks.
> 2.  **Performance-Oriented Architecture**: Employs advanced patterns like **"Parallel Pipelines"** and **"Guided Generation"** to break down complex AI tasks into smaller, simultaneous jobs. This significantly reduces latency for features like quiz and canvas generation while ensuring reliable, well-structured output.
> 3.  **Frictionless Development**: By using browser-native ES Modules and a CDN (`esm.sh`), the project avoids complex build steps. There's no `npm install`, no bundler configuration‚Äîjust modern web technologies.
> 4.  **User-Centric Design**: The entire experience is designed to be intuitive, engaging, and effective for learning. Data is stored locally in the user's browser, ensuring privacy and persistence without a backend.


## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

1.  **Create a Study Set**: Add your notes by pasting text, uploading files (`.pdf`, `.docx`, images, audio, etc.), or adding YouTube URLs. Your sets are saved for later.
2.  **Choose Your Path**:
    - **Read**: Generate a visual **Reading Canvas** from your notes. This creates a mind-map of interconnected concepts that you can explore interactively. Expand topics to get deeper insights, and watch the canvas intelligently reflow around your focus.
    - **Study**: The app analyzes your notes, identifies key topics, and lets you configure a quiz (Practice, Review, or Exam Mode) with various question types, including multiple choice, matching, and sequence.
    - **Spaced Repetition**: Start a review session that intelligently quizzes you on items you're close to forgetting.
    - **Predict**: Enter the Exam Prediction mode. Provide details about your teacher's style, upload past exams or quizzes, and let the AI generate a list of probable exam questions.
    - **Stats**: View your overall progress and topic performance on the statistics dashboard.
3.  **Take the Quiz**: Play through the generated quiz, score points, and actively learn the material. For exams, type your answers or upload photos of your work.
4.  **Get AI-Powered Results**: After an exam, the AI evaluates your answers, providing scores and constructive feedback. For practice quizzes, see a summary of your score and accuracy.
5.  **Review and Improve**: Dive into a detailed review of your answers. The **AI Study Coach** will give you personalized feedback on your strengths and weaknesses. From here, you can retake the same quiz, return to your sets, or instantly launch a new, focused quiz tailored to the topics you struggled with.


## üíª Tech Stack
This app is built with a modern, build-free stack, focusing on performance and developer experience.

-   **Core Framework**: [React](https://react.dev/) (with Hooks) & [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for a robust and type-safe UI.
-   **AI Engine**: [Google Gemini API](https://ai.google.dev/) using a suite of models (`gemini-2.5-pro`, `gemini-2.5-flash`, `gemini-2.5-flash-lite`) for intelligent features.
-   **Styling**: [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for a utility-first, responsive design system.
-   **Animation**: [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/) for fluid, physics-based UI animations.
-   **Module System**: Browser-native ES Modules loaded directly from the [esm.sh](https://esm.sh/) CDN. This eliminates the need for local `node_modules` or a bundling step.
-   **Client-Side File Processing**:
    -   [PDF.js](https://mozilla.github.io/pdf.js/) for parsing `.pdf` files.
    -   [Mammoth.js](https://github.com/mwilliamson/mammoth.js) for extracting text from `.docx` files.
    -   [SheetJS](https://sheetjs.com/) for handling `.xlsx` and `.csv` spreadsheets.
-   **Local Database**: [IndexedDB](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IndexedDB_API) (via `idb` library) for robust, persistent client-side storage.


## üîß Getting Started

This application is designed to run in a web-based development environment that can serve static files and provide environment variables.

### Prerequisites

- A modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).
- A Google Gemini API Key.

### Configuration

The application requires a Google Gemini API key to function. The key(s) must be available as an environment variable. The app checks for variables in the following order of precedence:

1.  **`API_KEY_POOL`**: For one or more keys, comma-separated. **This is the recommended method** for enabling load balancing and failover.
2.  **`API_KEY`**: A fallback for a single key, supported for backward compatibility.
3.  **`GEMINI_API_KEY`**: A final fallback, primarily for compatibility with certain development environments (like Vite configs that expose this variable).

#### Recommended Method (for one or more keys)

Use the `API_KEY_POOL` environment variable.

**Example with multiple keys:**
`API_KEY_POOL="key_one,key_two,key_three"`

**Example with a single key:**
`API_KEY_POOL="my_only_key"`

#### Fallback Methods (for a single key)

If `API_KEY_POOL` is not set, the app will look for `API_KEY` or `GEMINI_API_KEY`.

**Example:**
`API_KEY="my_single_key"`

or

`GEMINI_API_KEY="my_single_key"`

**Note**: It is best practice to use `API_KEY_POOL`. If `API_KEY_POOL` is set, all other key variables will be **ignored**.

### Running the Application

1. Ensure one of the API key environment variables is set (`API_KEY_POOL`, `API_KEY`, or `GEMINI_API_KEY`).
2. Serve the `index.html` file from the root of the project directory.
3. Open the served URL in your web browser. The application will initialize and be ready to use.

**Note**: This is a live web application under active development. If you are using a hosted version, please refresh the page periodically to access the latest features and improvements.

# vite.config.ts
import path from 'path';
import { defineConfig, loadEnv } from 'vite';

export default defineConfig(({ mode }) => {
    const env = loadEnv(mode, '.', '');
    return {
      define: {
        'process.env.API_KEY_POOL': JSON.stringify(env.API_KEY_POOL),
        'process.env.API_KEY': JSON.stringify(env.API_KEY),
        'process.env.GEMINI_API_KEY': JSON.stringify(env.GEMINI_API_KEY)
      },
      resolve: {
        alias: {
          '@': path.resolve(__dirname, '.'),
        }
      }
    };
});
